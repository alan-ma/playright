A text editer helping play writers format their scripts. Created for Cipher's local hack day in December 2016. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery.

This is an updated version of the application created during the hackathon - it now works locally (without a server) and has more functionality (saving via local storage, editing, and more).
